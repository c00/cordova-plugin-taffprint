# cordova-plugin-taffprint
A cordova plugin for Android to print text and images with Taffware Bluetooth POS printer.

The plugin was tested with model POS-5802D D. However this seems to be a white-labeled printer, so it's likely other printers are supported in the same way.

The SDK comes largely from the manufacturers installation CD (this came with Android examples).
